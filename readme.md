# Intermediate React vote workshop
This workshop should give you a very simple overview of redux-observable and how to use it in a simple react application.

## Todo
You have to complete the application using redux-observable to manage the side effects, you only need to complete:
- The actions
- The Epics

We left some `//TODO:` comments in the code for you to have a look and complete the missing code.

All the UI and the configuration bit is already done for you.

## Bonus
- Get the live update of the votes by listening the API socket
- Debounce the POST request for a vote

## Needed
- [Polls API](http://workshop.lastmilelink.technology:8080/)
- [Redux-observable documentation](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html)

## Stuck?
